        The game provides a Kalah board and a number of seeds or counters. The board has 12 small pits, called houses,
        on
        each side; and a big pit, called an end zone, at each end. The object of the game is to capture more seeds than
        one's opponent.

        <ul>
          <li>At the beginning of the game, six seeds are placed in each house. This is the traditional method.</li>
          <li>Each player controls the six houses and their seeds on the player's side of the board. The player's score
            is
            the
            number of seeds in the store to their right.
          </li>
          <li>Players take turns sowing their seeds. On a turn, the player removes all seeds from one of the houses
            under
            their
            control. Moving counter-clockwise, the player drops one seed in each house in turn, including the player's
            own
            store
            but not their opponent's.
          </li>
          <li>If the last sown seed lands in an empty house owned by the player, and the opposite house contains seeds,
            both
            the last seed and the opposite seeds are captured and placed into the player's store.
          </li>
          <li>If the last sown seed lands in the player's store, the player gets an additional move. There is no limit
            on
            the
            number of moves a player can make in their turn.
          </li>
          <li>When one player no longer has any seeds in any of their houses, the game ends. The other player moves all
            remaining seeds to their store, and the player with the most seeds in their store wins.
          </li>
        </ul>
